      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a frontend developer and little experience with backend development
        with a passion for creating beautiful and functional web experiences.
        With a solid background in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.js, I love
        building responsive and user-friendly websites that deliver seamless
        interactions.
      </p>
      <p>
        I graduated with a degree in Computer Science and have over 2 years of
        experience working with modern web development tools and technologies.
        I’ve built projects ranging from simple landing pages to full-fledged
        web applications, always with a focus on clean, efficient code and
        optimal user experience.
